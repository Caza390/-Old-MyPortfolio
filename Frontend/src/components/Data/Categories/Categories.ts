This was following the idea of the game I was working on, since the game were to follow a lo-poly style, I made the glock like this. If I recall correctly - this model had the ability to move the slide back. You could also see where I attempted to colour a part.",

First I checked around to see if there were any about, before creating this item. This is the first time I went to make a 3D printed model and had to make sure I set my measurements right before sending it to the printer. When I first created this model I had some what of a different idea but resulted to making this due to my beginner level in 3D printing. I also needed to make sure the badge holders would fit the model so I created a template in blender too.",
