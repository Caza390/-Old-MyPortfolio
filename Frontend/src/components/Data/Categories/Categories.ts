If I recall correctly - this model had the ability to move the slide back. You could also see where I attempted to colour a part.",

First I checked around to see if there were any about, before creating this item. This is the first time I went to make a 3D printed model and had to make sure I set my measurements right before sending it to the printer. When I first created this model I had some what of a different idea but resulted to making this due to my beginner level in 3D printing. I also needed to make sure the badge holders would fit the model so I created a template in blender too.",

One system that started this whole project off is relating to my job. Since my job is somewhat complicated with a lot of information, it is hard to retain, or answer customers for their specific questions. Next was the issue of collegues not knowing how to order parts or which parts are for what camera and how to check. Lastly is the problem of collegues struggling to find the right approach on installing dash cameras in cars and my experience of having to fix problems left by other stores or mobile services. The second project with a better life quality for staff at Halfords is the warrenty tools. We use a booklet which contains a lot of small numbers but no detailed images or description to the tools. On the computer system the problem is similar and not so helpful. This is where my system comes in.",
