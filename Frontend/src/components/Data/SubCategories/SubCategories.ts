      description: "Since I was just testing everything, I didn't really think much about colour schemes for the site aside from following the bands logo colours. I also drafted a rough idea to describe the band, which I sent over to the group to provide them with a demo. The purpose of this site was for us to use when looking for places to play. It was intended to showcase merchandise we had with Mindstorm Productions , videos of our performances, an 'about us' section, and links to our social media pages â€” something good enough for the band to promote and share.",

        description: "While I was taking the QA Bootcamp course, they mentioned about building a portfolio site. Since my skills and knowledge were more limited here on site development, I wasn't able to design my site as good as I hoped. Looking back at the site, it reminds me sites people would make un the early 2000's.  In this version of the site, I didn't exactly have the knowledge or the know how on web development which explains the poor design choice that I made. Eventually my job picked up with more hours, taking me away from working on this site. This site had many issues to it which I later learnt from - firstly I learned a whole new way on site development, secondly the background colour where the text HOMEPAGE was not matching right and the text did not match the rest of the tabs at the top. I also had issue with the dropdown menu not fitting correctly.",

        description: "When I build this version of my site I learnt about the user interface called VueJs and decided to give myself a challenge using this method. You can see where my current version of my portfolio highly takes place. Originally with this page, I was going to make it so when you click on one of the tabs at the top, the options would be at the side. Somewhat like like how this current site works. But I also ended up coming into complications which I fixed using Router. This version of my portfolio was going to hold all my skills from software, music, animation, game development, blender, automotive and many more. I also wanted to try using ASP.NET and SQL but I hit my major roadblock - aka I didn't know what I was doing.",

        description: "This was the original home page idea... well sort of. The image on the home page would, of course, not be that. But I needed something to be a temporary placement for the time being. The same goes with the text on the page. I needed to give myself a general idea on what I needed and where I needed everything. This does follow the previous concept I had in the old version (version two).  The home page was going to be where users would log into the page. Before I removed the login option, infact I changed the login to have it's own page to make it less complicated and confusing... again that was before I scrapped the idea. the goal of the accounts would link to different hidden options. Although I still plan to do that task in the future, for now I can always fine another alternative method and right now, I'm making this site work for the career I am wanting to get into which is software development.  I also took on the challenge to make the idea version of my site in Photoshop. Usually I would use a program called Paint.NET but found that Photoshop was a more effective for such a task.",

        description: "Originally I wrote this site to have every text to be written in Arial font. I personally liked Arial for it's simplistic cartoony look and was the first normal font I came across. But after showing my site to some people, one person mentioned that Arial was not a font to go for. Confused I looked into it and from what I gathered, Airal is disliked among developers but loved by graphic designers. I have also learnt that the font has similarites to Helvetica. The differences aren't too noticable for the common user. But I decided to make the changes. The titles and subtitles of this site will now use Verdana and normal text should be Helvetica... But so far on my end, font where Helvetica should be is still Arial.",

I am proud of my achievement in designing my first ever site and taking on feedback. But the there were just so much that I wasn't sure off. I wanted to move onto something cleaner, better and more appealing. the next project will contain a backend and frontend. Along with some better UI design and suited to show more of my skills and experience.",

One problem I have come accross is when the player is looking down, they don't move as fast - this will be something I will have to look into later",

But to stop the abuse of over using the sprint function I wanted to create a stamina limitation. So using this video, I managed to add the ability to sprint for a set amount of time before having to wait a little bit before you can run at full capacity. A current bug I am seeing right now is when the player holds shift, despite not moving the stamina will still go down.",

This is where a great tool known as the flashlight comes in. I also made it so the player can pick up the flashlight, creating a real object to be placed in their hand compared to just shining from the players face. The current problem I am facing with my light is a possible Lumen cause. This wasn't something I had to deal with before and from my current research and asking for help, it just lead me down a problem that doesn't seem to be fixable (for now of course) I used my old UE4 tutorial and some other help by Gorka Games.",
