# MyPortfolio
This is my portfolio site. This site is to show my skills as a programmer. Keeping this site up-to-date with latest information for the jobs that I am applying for.

Originally I was going to use ASP.NET and SQL Server. But since I don't have a lot of experience + the fact I need this site to be made much sooner, I will just use Vue and its built in API system.
I was also going to impliment the idea of a login system for different situations like music, but felt that would be too much of a challenge for my skill. But perhaps it will be something I could look into for the future.

### Why VueJs
I learnt Vue 3 from a BSpoke. Because of this, at least for the time being, I felt Vue would be a best for me to work on for now.
There is the idea of trying React due to its popularity, which I do plan to experiment with eventually but for now and comfort for this portfolio, I will be using Vue.

# Future plans
I am curently working on a new setup. I want to show more of my interests while keeping my technical skills together. So there will be a new tab system showing "Tech, Auto, Model, CV". These are the projects that will be added to the website.
### Tech:
- Unlike before where I had "projects, Game Dev, Model and CV" I will now be keeping both Project and Game Dev in the same tab. This will not only benefit the site to look more active but also aim to keep my technical skills together.
### Auto:
- I have a lot of Auto experience from working in a bodyshop to fitting dashcams and radios for Halfords. It only makes sense to have a tab specifically for this field of work to show off my ability there. Lastly it is also because I would one day like to explore the Software side of the Auto trade world.
### Models:
- I like to keep this tab to itself. This is because I work on many modelling projects for gaming, 3D printing and one day automotive projects.

As mentioned the interest of tech and automotive has lead me to strive for a role in the auto industry. Hopefully this portfolio would grant that to be a future possibility!
