# MyPortfolio
This is a portfolio site. It will be created with VUE 3, as that is a web UI framework which I am comfortable working with. I eventually plan to include ASP.NET to enable authentication on the portfolio site and allow for data uploads using my database, rather than just placing content on the site, to enhance performance.

I'm not entirely sure about the approach I will take, but I have a basic understanding of Vue, and I have some experience with ASP.NET.

# Beginning stages.
I have an idea for the layout based on a previous plan. The issue with that site was that my monitor colour was not set correctly. I will use Adobe Photoshop to help create my layout due to the added benefit of folders, which my preferred tool Paint.NET lack. Additionally, I will create different branches to make my work easier and more effective, especially when reviewing history. I will use various research methods, such as Stack Overflow, Reddit, ChatGPT, etc., to enhance my learning.

# VUE 3
With Vue 3, I will be working with TypeScript, Router, and Tailwind CSS. There are possibilities that I might include components like Carousel and Pinia. However, I know that I should use Axios when communicating with the API. The components I have experimented with the most in Vue are TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Carousel; hence, I am using them.
