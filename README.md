# MyPortfolio
This is my portfolio site. This site is to show my skills as a programmer. Keeping this site up-to-date with latest information for the jobs that I am applying for.

Originally I was going to use ASP.NET and SQL Server. But since I don't have a lot of experience + the fact I need this site to be made much sooner, I will just use Vue and its built in API system.
I was also going to impliment the idea of a login system for different situations like music, but felt that would be too much of a challenge for my skill. But perhaps it will be something I could look into for the future.

# Why VueJs
I learnt Vue 3 from a BSpoke. Because of this, at least for the time being, I felt Vue would be a best for me to work on for now.
There is the idea of trying React due to its popularity, which I do plan to experiment with eventually but for now and comfort for this portfolio, I will be using Vue.

# Future plans
Future plans for this site is to keep improving and adding information to it.
I know the phone layouts don't work right, so that is something I can activly look into.
I want to work on a game project, finish it and release it for the public - somewhat of a Slender-Man theme due to its basic function and design.
An attempt to work on a site just like my brothers - this will need the skills for datebase creating using an API for speed. Possibly made in React too.
