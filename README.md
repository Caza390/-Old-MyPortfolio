# MyPortfolio
This is my portfolio site. This site is to show my skills as a programmer. Keeping this site up-to-date with latest information for the jobs that I am applying for.

Originally I was going to use ASP.NET and SQL Server. But since I don't have a lot of experience + the fact I need this site to be made much sooner, I will just use Vue as a default, if I need to make an database like system I'll use Vue's build in system. But hopefully by that point I have the confidence and time to use ASP.NET and SQL Server.
I was also going to impliment the idea of a login system for different situations like music, but felt that would be too much of a challenge for my skill. But perhaps it will be something I could look into for the future.

# Why VueJs
I learnt Vue 3 from a BSpoke. Because of this, I feel - at least for the time being, Vue would be a best for me to work on for now.
There is the idea of trying React due to its popularity, which I do plan to experiment with eventually but for now and comfort for this portfolio, I will be using Vue.
