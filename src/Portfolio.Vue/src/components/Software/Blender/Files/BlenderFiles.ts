        description: "This model was used in a 3D print for my brother. He needed a stand to fit his badges and asked if I could print him a badge stand. First I checked around to see if there were any about, before creating this item. This is the first time I went to make a 3D printed model and had to make sure I set my measurements right before sending it to the printer. When I first created this model I had some what of a different idea but resulted to making this due to my beginner level in 3D printing. I also needed to make sure the badge holders would fit the model so I created a template in blender too.",
